                    Final Fantasy VIII is a 1999 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the
                    PlayStation console. It is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Set on an
                    unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows a group of young mercenaries,
                    led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by a sorceress named Edea Kramer
                    who seized control of a powerful military state. During the quest to defeat the sorceress and the
                    forces manipulating her, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of
                    his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.
